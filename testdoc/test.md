## <span id="path/search">/search</span>

### GET

Searches for hotels with their information.

#### Passing arrays
arrays should be passed with comma-separated strings no mater if they are numbers or strings.
There is no need to put strings in the `""` or `”`.
for example
```
boundingBox=46.650828100116044,7.123046875,45.17210966999772,1.009765625
attributes=hotelEntities,offerEntities,hotelIds
```

#### Stay parameters
There are four stay parameters `dayDistance`,`nights`,`checkIn` and `checkOut`.
According to these parameters `Stay` struct will be initialized.
```go
	type Stay struct {
		CheckIn  Date
		CheckOut Date
		Nights   int
	}
```
 The logic is as follows

- If `checkIn != empty` and `checkOut != empty` => `Nights = CheckOut - CheckIn`
- If `checkIn != empty` and `nights != nil` => `CheckOut = CheckIn + Nights`
- If `checkIn == empty` and `checkOut != empty` and `nights != nil` => `CheckIn = CheokOut - Nights`
- If `nights != nil` and `dayDistance != nil` => `CheckIn = Now() + dayDistance` and then `CheokOut = CheckIn + Nights`
- If `dayDistance != nil` and `checkOut != empty` => `CheckIn = Now() + dayDistance` and then `Nights = CheckOut - CheckIn`
- Otherwise => `CheckIn = Now() + dayDistance + the_days_til_the_last_day_of_the_week` and `CheckOut = CheckIn + 1` and `Nights = 1`

#### Sample search request
```
GET http://dikcjxfwieazv.cloudfront.net/search?offset=0&profileId=findhotel-website&hotelId=1096743&checkIn=2022-03-19&checkOut=2022-03-20&rooms=2&currency=USD&language=en&variations=pp000004-tags2-a%2Cc48b82da-sapi-backend-b%2Ca41n36ps-sapi-offers-a&anonymousId=ecfedb21-ed3f-4a28-aff4-119ef0a04fa1
