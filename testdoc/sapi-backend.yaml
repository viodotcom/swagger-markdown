                    A correlation id used in Analytics to identify different searches.
                    Sapi SDK generates a new unique value per each new user search and passes it to Sapi Backend to both /search and /offers endpoints, the same value.
                    Value is changed when a new search initiated, check documentation for Sapi SDK for details what is considered a new search.

                    Sapi Backend passes it to RAA when retrieving offers.

                    If not provided, generated as UUID.

                    Metadata is an url encoded values contains additional information about the request.
                    They will be sent to RAA as part of the url parameters in the request in the form of key=value.
                    this value should contain a list of key/value pairs, for example we can use it to pass esd and epv values.
                    so if we want to pass esd=xyz&epv=abc to RAA the value of metadata should be esd%3Dxyz%26epv%3Dabc

                Searches for hotels with their information.

                #### Passing arrays
                arrays should be passed with comma-separated strings no mater if they are numbers or strings.
                There is no need to put strings in the `""` or `”`.
                for example
                ```
                boundingBox=46.650828100116044,7.123046875,45.17210966999772,1.009765625
                attributes=hotelEntities,offerEntities,hotelIds
                ```

                #### Stay parameters
                There are four stay parameters `dayDistance`,`nights`,`checkIn` and `checkOut`.
                According to these parameters `Stay` struct will be initialized.
                ```go
                	type Stay struct {
                		CheckIn  Date
                		CheckOut Date
                		Nights   int
                	}
                ```
                 The logic is as follows

                - If `checkIn != empty` and `checkOut != empty` => `Nights = CheckOut - CheckIn`
                - If `checkIn != empty` and `nights != nil` => `CheckOut = CheckIn + Nights`
                - If `checkIn == empty` and `checkOut != empty` and `nights != nil` => `CheckIn = CheokOut - Nights`
                - If `nights != nil` and `dayDistance != nil` => `CheckIn = Now() + dayDistance` and then `CheokOut = CheckIn + Nights`
                - If `dayDistance != nil` and `checkOut != empty` => `CheckIn = Now() + dayDistance` and then `Nights = CheckOut - CheckIn`
                - Otherwise => `CheckIn = Now() + dayDistance + the_days_til_the_last_day_of_the_week` and `CheckOut = CheckIn + 1` and `Nights = 1`

                    A correlation id used in Analytics to identify different searches.
                    Sapi SDK generates a new unique value per each new user search and passes it to Sapi Backend to both /search and /offers endpoints, the same value.
                    Value is changed when a new search initiated, check documentation for Sapi SDK for details what is considered a new search.

                    Sapi Backend passes it to RAA when retrieving offers.

                    If not provided, generated as UUID.
